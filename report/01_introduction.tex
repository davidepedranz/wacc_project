\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this project, we developed a web-application to manage a Docker Swarm cluster. The application is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy to deploy and manage.
It allows user to visualize the running services, create new services, modify or delete the running ones, and visualize the real-time events happening in the cluster.
Besides, the access to the application is restricted to only authenticated and authorized users. Thus, only the administrator is able to assign and revoke permissions to the users. 

\cref{sec:architecture} describes the general architecture of the application, the functionalities provided by each component, the strategies adopted to resist failures and the most important design choices.
\cref{sec:deployment} discusses how the application is deployed in order to be fault-tolerant from the point of view of the infrastructure (e.g. resist the crash of an entire virtual machine in the cluster).
\cref{sec:conclusions} summarizes the work accomplished, the achieved results and possible improvements or future developments for the application.
